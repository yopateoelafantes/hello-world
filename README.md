Hey, my name is Logan Surface. I am currently a senior at Boswell High School and a captain on the computer science UIL team. I have been programming since the eight grade when my twin brother, Lane, introduced me to the wonderful world of technology. Right now my interests include high end hardware and networking equipment and data hoarding. If you need to get in contact with me then email me at: surfacelogan@gmail.com
